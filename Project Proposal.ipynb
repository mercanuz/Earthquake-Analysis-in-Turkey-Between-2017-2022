As the metering stations are placed in Turkey most of the recorded earthquakes are in latitudes between 35 - 45; longitudes 25 - 45. The database search time filter was set to dates 27/09/1910 to 27/09/2017. As there are too many earthquakes which have intensities smaller than 4.0, the filter of intensity was set to 3.5 to 9.0 (there was no earthquakes recorded larger than 9.0 intensity)."

Besides the expected big Istanbul earthquake, it can be used in life choices, investments and more. We can evaluate the probability of earthquake and shape our investments by the lowest loss risk. The risk of eartquakes is an important investment condition for invertors. Investors can safely invest to towns where the earthquake risk is low and it can be helpful for them to planning their capital in the long run."
