    "Especially when we are living in the Istanbul and waiting for a very big earthquake, this project can be really helpful for minimizing the loss of lives. Besides the expected big Istanbul earthquake, it can be used in life choices, investments and more. We can evaluate the probability of earthquake and shape our investments by the lowest loss risk. The risk of eartquakes is an important investment condition for invertors. Investors can safely invest to towns where the earthquake risk is low and it can be helpful for them to planning their capital in the long run."

How are they going to help you to answer the questions? Are the experiments you did verify your hypothesis? How? How are you going to know if the results of your experiments confirm and fail to confirm you hypothesis? I am going to see a detailed methodology section on these points.\n",
